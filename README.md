# DICOM viewer for [Atom](http://atom.io)

## Overview

This package provides a point-and-click interface for exploring the content of [DICOM](http://dicom.nema.org/) files. At the moment, the functionality provided is allowing to run [DCMTK](http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en) command-line tools [dcmdump](http://support.dcmtk.org/docs/dcmdump.html) and [dsrdump](http://support.dcmtk.org/docs/dsrdump.html).

By using this Atom package instead of running the DCMTK tools in the command
line, you can:

* conveniently copy content to the clipboard
* do folding of the indented sections of the dump
* search for content of interest
* add a lot more features using powerful Atom engine ;)
